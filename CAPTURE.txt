Same reports on @116655 from other FiOS users around the north east.  Is this something Verizon is investigating or could join in on?  Been over 4 hours of outage for some. https://t.co/2Ecdop6zl1
I did
Yes
Nope. A few states away actually. The airbnb we're in doesn't have espnews so we signed in with our Verizon account to go to espn3 and watch. Doesn't allow us. Which I don't get since I know we have espnews back home

FiOS. And I love it. Not a single problem in 9 years.
Literally every day I have this same twitter conversation with @verizonsupport. Yâ€™all ask how things are going now that everything works it doesnâ€™t so I go to the link for secure chat give my info and get the news that itâ€™s a group outage that will be fixed at 9pm that day.""17799"
Apologies canâ€™t pay my office rent or replace the missed client calls. Iâ€™m going out of business because yâ€™all canâ€™t fix a phone line in
